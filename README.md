# USDA-Plant-Species-Clustering-Prediction   
## 1. Project Overview  
- <b> Objective: </b> Analyze and cluster plant species distribution across the United States to support environmental planning and agricultural decision-making.
- <b> Dataset: </b> USDA Plant Dataset (34,781 samples, 70 features).
- <b> Stakeholders: </b> Environmental agencies, agricultural planners, researchers.

## 2. Business Needs & Goals  
- Identify geographic patterns in plant species distribution.
- Detect outliers or anomalies in plant clustering to support conservation strategies.
- Provide data-driven insights for agricultural planning and biodiversity management.

## 3. Data Preparation & Analysis Approach  
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, standardized features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized species distribution by state and ecological regions.
- Clustering Models Tested: K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, Autoencoder-based clustering.
- Evaluation Metrics: Silhouette Score, WCSS (Elbow Method).

## 4. Key Deliverables  
- Heatmaps and visual dashboards of plant species distribution.
- Clustering comparison chart with evaluation scores.
- Documentation of methodology and findings for stakeholders.

## 5. Key Findings & Insights  
- DBSCAN achieved the highest performance (Silhouette Score â‰ˆ 0.57).
- Certain species show regional concentration, while others are widely distributed.
- Results can inform environmental protection, crop planning, and biodiversity strategies.

## 6. Skills Applied  
Data Cleaning, EDA, Clustering Analysis, Data Visualization, Statistical Evaluation, Insight Communication  

## 7. Reflection  
This project strengthened my ability to analyze large datasets, evaluate multiple models, and translate technical results into actionable business insights for decision-makers.
